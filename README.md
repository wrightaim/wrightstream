## Philosophy
Our mission is to assist artisans with business planning so they can focus on  what they do best — creating.

## About
WrightStream is a web, tablet, and mobile application designed to make day-to-day business operations smoother for makers, builders, and crafters by automating their workflow.

### A Focused Platform
Manage the fundamental aspects of your business all in one place. Equipped with robust and powerful tools such as the workflow dashboard and an inventory management system, we take the drudgery out of the picture so you have less to worry about.

### Simplified & Functional
With a smooth and intuitive interface, you no longer have to deal with messy notebooks and documents, scrambling to manually update inventory and purchases. Strive in automation where the process is streamlined for you so you know what step to take next.

### Built for Growth
When hundreds of orders come in, it becomes a challenge to keep track of inventory changes, mass production, purchase management, and shipping procedures. With a combined, manageable workflow, your business can expand while keeping products personalized and close to the heart.

### Aids Teamwork
Make task assignment and tracking a breeze for both you and your employees by limiting their access from parts of the workflow that don’t involve their productivity. All they need to worry about is creating products — everything else doesn’t matter.


## Features

### Workflow Dashboard
Our app imports all purchases from e-commerce sites like Etsy and Shopify and creates a dashboard that serves as a hub for everything your customers have bought from your store. Each purchase will show what products were ordered, the supplies needed and steps required to make each product, in addition to other post-production operations, such as quality check and delivery.

### Inventory Management
Besides having an interface that guides you through the production and distribution procedures, our app also includes an inventory management system that is fully integrated with the workflow dashboard. Every time products are in queue to be crafted, supplies needed to make the products are automatically deducted from the inventory. Say goodbye to your calculator!

### Estimator & Lists
An innovative feature we’ve decided to implement is the estimator, which is essentially a tool that calculates all the supplies you’ll need to make the products you want, all in one shopping list. This list can then be saved for when you order your supplies. Want to compare your list to your inventory first? No problem! Check this option and in stock supplies will automatically be subtracted from your list so you’re not ordering supplies you already have!

### Staff Management
We know how difficult it is to manage more than a couple of people in a workshop setting, especially when every product is custom-made. Our app allows shop owners and managers to assign tasks to employees, which employees can then see in their personalized dashboard. That way, they can minimize distractions and focus on creating without compromising an organized workflow.

## Creators
WrightStream was created by two developers, [Claudia](https://github.com/claudialigidakis) and [Vika](https://github.com/vikandagonzales). As former classmates in the Galvanize Web Development program, the two quickly bonded over their shared passion for making things and solving problems. With WrightStream, they're doing both!

Claudia and Vika make the dream team — having diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and personalities ensured all bases would be covered, from the planning stages all the way to execution. While Claudia has a knack for formulating ideas to fix real-world issues, Vika meticulously plots small-scale solutions to steadily fulfill Claudia’s big picture. Previously a designer, Vika loves the front-end and everything beautiful, spending most of her time crafting an experience that is as intuitive as possible. Meanwhile, Claudia takes care of the back-end as she loves connecting the pieces behind the scenes to make the result seamless and functional.

The two don’t intend on stopping after WrightStream. Together, they hope to continue creating to solve problems and help others.
